# Overview

Oh hello! This is just an app to help me run the RPG game that I made, Quan. It doesn't have any sort of authorization, logging in, or security as I'm running it just for myself locally on my own system. It's also pretty sloppy because I just work on it as I have time. If you're a potential employer, don't refrain from looking; just keep in mind that this project is the roughest of drafts.

Currently I'm just working my way through basic functionality before pollishing everything up.

Take a look at tabbing in the Locations component. Routes are generated ad hoc, so you can direct the app to nested tabs written by the app itself upon loading.

The Action component doesn't make nearly the use of React that it could, and the rest of the app needs to be plugged into Redux; I'll be refactoring all of that once basic functionality is all complete.

How the server returns data is sort of a mess. In most cases it does its work and then just returns the entire database. I'll be re-working that.

BE testing was written, though I haven't updated it for some time and it's not passing. I'll re-do that some time...

I have done next to no design; that will come last.
