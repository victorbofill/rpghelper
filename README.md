# Overview

Oh hello! This is just an app to help me run the RPG game that I made, Quan. It doesn't have any sort of authorization as I just run it locally. It's also pretty sloppy because I just work on it as I have time. If you're a potential employer, don't refrain from looking; just keep in mind that this project is the roughest of drafts :)

The project is vertically complete. I've run into the problem of "where should the complexity lie"? I refactored the Routes, Header, and Edit components to be entirely universal, but it's caused a web of data flow rather than a reduction of complexity. I can move that complexity to each individual component, but I'm not too keen on doing that. I've also written my way into a strucutre that essentially requires uniform data throughout, which serves for now, but I can't guarantee it will forever. But the app can do everything I need it to for now, so that may not be a problem.

For now I'll move on to design and front-end functionality, but I'll keep vertical flow in mind.
