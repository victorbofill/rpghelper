# Overview

Oh hello! This is just an app to help me run the RPG game that I made, Quan. It doesn't have any sort of authorization, logging in, or security as I'm running it just for myself locally on my own system. It's also pretty sloppy because I just work on it as I have time. If you're a potential employer, don't refrain from looking; just keep in mind that this project is the roughest of drafts. My next project is going to be re-writing how the app pulls data from the database, and how the routes return data; things things in particular are sort of a mess right now.

Take a look at tabbing in the Locations component. Routes are generated ad hoc, so you can direct the app to nested tabs with the URL.

The Action component doesn't make nearly the use of React that it could; I'll be re-writing that.

Most BE routes are written, but few are utilized so far. That's my next step.

BE testing is written, though I haven't updated it for some time. I'll take a look at that some time.

I have done next to no design; that will come last.
