# Overview

Oh hello! This is just an app to help me run the RPG game that I made, Quan. It doesn't have any sort of authorization, logging in, or security as I'm running it just for myself locally on my own system. It's also pretty sloppy because it's a completely personal project. If you're a potential employer, don't refrain from looking; just keep in mind that this project is the roughest of drafts. My next project is going to be re-writing how the app pulls data from the database, and how the routes return data; things things in particular are sort of a mess right now.
